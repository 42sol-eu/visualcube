# VisualCube TS
Fork of [VisualCube](https://github.com/Cride5/visualcube), a great Rubik's cube svg image generator. This version is a javascript library that can be used to embed Rubik's cube images in a page, without pre-rendering an image server side.

### Installation Instructions
TBD

### Features 
* Fully 3D cube visualisation

### Still need to implement from Cride5's version
* Cube dimensions from 1x1x1 to NxNxN. Currently capped at 9x9 for performance.
* Complete orientation control
* Cube and facelet transparency
* Custom colour schemes and background
* Image caching for speedy access
* Cookie configurable variables
* Arrow overlays
